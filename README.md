# Machine Learning with Python
Machine Learning or statistical learning is a set of mathematical algorithms that make inferences from the data, make sense of the data, and solve problems such as prediction/regression and classification using a number of statistical tools.

## Machine Learning is divided into 3 groups:

1) Supervised Learning:
It is a learning method in which a reference dataset consisting of inputs and outputs is given to the model. The model updates its values with iterations according to the reference outputs. For example, classification estimation/regression problems are solved by this type of learning method.

2) Unsupervised Learning:
It is a type of learning where inputs are given to the model but reference outputs are not known. For example, in the customer segmentation application, the customer extracts clusters with similar behavior from the data. Thus, the appropriate audience for the products to be sold is determined. Such clustering and size reduction problems can be solved by this type of learning method.

3) Reinforcement Learning:
It is an instinctive learning style. It is the learning factor that receives feedback as a result of interacting with the environment and accordingly finds the optimum policy. An example is a baby's adopting a policy of not touching something hot, as a result of which his hand is burned. This type of learning has application areas such as games and maze solving.
